    "In module 1 you explored the `os` module and used some of its methods to interact with the file system. You changed the working directory, listed the content of a path, created new directories, removed directories, and renamed files and directories. In addition to these utilities, Python's `os` module allows you to remove specific files using the `os.remove(path)` or `os.unlink(path)` functions. Both functions are semantically identical; however, their functionality slightly differs depending on the platform running your program. For now, we will consider them equivalent and use `os.remove(path)` to delete a file."

    "In the previous example, you anticipated some errors and tried to avoid them by testing that a path exists and whether it is to a file or directory. However, you still assumed the results of these tests are static and won't change while your program is running. This assumption might lead to errors again. For example, say you test for the existence of a file and determine that the file exists at the given path, and right after that another program moves the file; if your program attempts to remove the file, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError` because the file no longer exists in that location. Of course, this is considered an unhandled exception and your program will stop executing and display the error message as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's philosophy in this case is to deal with these errors as exceptions and handle them using the techniques you saw in a previous lesson. This way, you can also deal with unexpected exceptions."

    "After interacting with a file in Python, it is very important to close the file to ensure that all output is written properly and the resources are freed. Sometimes an exception is raised before reaching the `close()` statement, and the file is kept open. This issue can be resolved by placing the `close()` statement inside a `finally` clause. However, because the process of opening and closing a file is very common, Python provides a succinct `with` statement that performs the same task. The syntax of the `with` statement is:\n",
